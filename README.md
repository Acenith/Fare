NAutomaton
===================

<b>NOTE: The porting of code is at early stage. Work in progress.</b>

The NAutomaton is a .NET library which contains a DFA/NFA (finite-state automata) implementation with Unicode alphabet (UTF16) and support for the standard regular expression operations (concatenation, union, Kleene star) and a number of non-standard ones (intersection, complement, etc.). NAutomaton is a .NET port of the well 
established Java library [dk.brics.automaton](http://www.brics.dk/automaton/) with API as close as possible to the corresponding dk.brics.automaton classes.
