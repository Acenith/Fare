
This is the first release of the Automata toolkit V1 from Microsoft Research.

The release comes with a collection of binaries in the bin directory and two sample directories.

The Main libraries in the bin directory are: 
  1) Microsoft.Automata.dll
  2) Microsoft.Automata.Z3.dll

The library (2) depends on Microsoft.Z3.dll that is included in the bin directory.
All libraries are compiled for the x86 platform and require .Net v4.0.

The two sample directories are 
  - AutomataSamples, that illustrate use of library (1)
  - AutomataZ3Samples, that illustrate use of a combination of all the included libraries.
Both directories have a README file that provides a high-level overview 
of the included samples and how to run the examples.
